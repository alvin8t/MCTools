You may join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/qjKa853) for suggestions or other things.

# Installation (First Time)
1. Go to the releases page [here](https://github.com/alvin8t/MCTools/releases) and download the Installer (you can also access the installation page by clicking on the Resleases button found above the green 'Clone or Download' button and just to the left).
2. Once the installer is installed, run the program.
3. Let it do it's magic.
4. That's it! The program should launch itself once the installer is finished. If an error box pops up, click 'OK' and relaunch it from your desktop (This is a known issue, it just because required files already exist and it couldn't overwrite them or some required files couldn't be found and aren't needed for launching, but needed for installing)
